<P> TigerBites is a no-effort app that hungry Princeton students 
    can use in order to keep track of their favorite foods. Users
    can populate a favorites list of the best food on campus,
    accompanied by helpful information to help make informed 
    eating decisions, so that they never miss a good meal. 

<P> The app is has been submitted to the Google play store. Alternatively, the app 
    can be run via computer/on an iPhone with Expo installed by 
    downloading the code from git, installing Node, and running with 
    npm start. We plan to schedule a block of time during testing to allow TAs to 
    play with the app on team members' devices in case there are issues with getting
    the app on the play store. 

<p> No passwords or administrative access should be needed. 

<P> If there is an issue accessing the app, contact Eric at ethoman@princeton.edu. Any other 
    issue is probably a server issue, and you can contact arettew@princeton.edu.

<P> The report and product guide links must point to PDF files <b>with <i>exactly</i> the
specified names, all lower case</b>.  
They must not require logging into some place like Google Docs or
GitHub.  We need all submission materials in one place and completely
uniform at this level so we can access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
